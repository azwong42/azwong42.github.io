        <h2>Walkthrough Info for the Vantage™ Productivity Portal</h2>
        <b>What am I supposed to be doing?</b><br>
        The most important thing to know is that you can log out of the account using the "Log Out"
        button in the upper right (hidden in the ID card menu, which is accessed by clicking the circle with the AH in it).
        This will allow you to view achievement names, which are little jokes or puns that should hopefully guide you
        toward the action required to unlock the achievement.
        <br><br>
        Note also that completing a relevant action does not always award an achievement immediately--if you think you
        should be earning an achievement but aren't, try waiting about 15 seconds before pressing "log out". Not everyone
        responds immediately!
        <br><br>
        <b>Why are some of the achievements obscured?</b><br>
        You probably don't have the ability to complete those yet. Most of the achievements require completion of "I'm In"--
        once you've done that, it should become fairly obvious why.
        <br><br>
        <b>Just walk me through the achievements.</b><br>
